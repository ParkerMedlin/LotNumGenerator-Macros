# Update Notes

### 12-6-2021
 - removed the extra (unnecessary) subroutine PullShtPrint. The only thing it was doing was displaying an inputBox for the number of copies to be printed. Shawn informed me that we only ever need one copy of this sheet, so I removed the option (you can just click it twice if you really need multiple copies).
